To reproduce the analysis shown in the paper the following steps should be respected: 
# To reproduce the analysis of the core model:
1. Source the file "ZF_core_model.R"
2. Source the file "ZF_core_model_fit.R" 
# To redo the actual optimization of the core model (This is not recommended!)
1. Source the file "ZF_core_model.R"
2. Uncomment the designated code parts in the file "ZF_core_model_fit.R" 
3. Adapt the spefications of the machine you want to use to run the fits on
4. Execute the script in the file "ZF_core_model_fit.R" line-by-line
# To reproduce the analysis of the  mini-models:
1. Source the file "ZF_minimodels.R"
2. Source the file "ZF_minimodels_fit.R" 
# To redo the actual optimization of the mini-models (This is not recommended!)
1. Source the file "ZF_minimodels.R"
2. Uncomment the designated code parts in the file "ZF_minimodels_fit.R" 
3. Adapt the spefications of the machine you want to use to run the fits on
